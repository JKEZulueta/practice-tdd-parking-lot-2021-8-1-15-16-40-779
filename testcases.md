Story 2
As a parking lot manager, I would like to give some friendly reminder message when a customer cannot park/fetch a car. So that the customer can know what happens.
AC1: When the customer fetches car with a wrong ticket (unrecognized ticket / the ticket has been used). Then no car should be fetched, with error message "Unrecognized parking ticket.".
AC2: When the customer attempt to park a car into a parking lot without any position. The error message should be "No available position."

Case 1[] - 
Given - 
When - Customer fetches car with wrong ticket
